# Sunspot Activity Dashboard

Solar activity may seem far from daily life here on Earth, but it can have several real-world implications. High levels of solar activity can interfere with satellite communications and power systems leading it to be a topic of interest for members of those industries. Sunspots in particular are considered to be an indicator of high solar activity and thus a sunspot dashboard can be utilized to understand solar activity trends.

This interactive dashboard explores solar activity trends using Plotly and HTML packages Python. There are three different visualizations that all display various details of solar activity including a line chart, a scatterplot, and an animated image. Both the line chart and scatterplot include user input values that will adjust the display of the figures. Hopefully this dashboard is a resource that can be used to better understand and predict sunspot and solar activity behavior before it happens.
